### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. The major thing I learned during this project is that you should properly plan projects before you start working on them.
2. Never try to complete a project in 1 big session. Instead spread it out among completing different aspects over small sessions of coding during a few days.

### Useful resources

- [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped me find other useful things to implement by not only giving me what I searched for, but a good few other things I could use in my project.
